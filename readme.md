# DEFUNKT
The status checker is abandoned, since the PHP portion of the bot is also abandoned

## AnubisBot Status Branch
This branch is used to do a status check on AnubisBot. (Built specifically for me, but can easilly be adapted to any instance)

## Output
The output is an SVG image as shown here: [![AnubisBot Status](https://api.kalebklein.com/anubisbot_status)](https://api.kalebklein.com/anubisbot_status
)
